<h2>About Us</h2>
	
	<div class="firstDiv">
		<p> Oven Fresh Bakery has been in the business for over 32 years established in 1991. It started as a small tea selling business imported from Nepal to close 
            friends and later by baking morning biscuit. The founder, Nepalese-American, Mr. Kumar Singh started this business in 1991 with his wife, who was passionate about baking to support their family.
            The couple opened a small shop where they would serve their family and friends, who missed the taste of Nepal's tea. Their shop were slowly discovered by some American customers including an editor for the Times paper.
            Due to the popularity of the hand picked tea leaves and famous American goods, the place slowly became first choice for many people. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We have been serving the taste of Nepal and America for the last 32 years, we will never fail to lose the reputation. Our goal will always remain to bring the best of both worlds and provide it to all of our customers.
